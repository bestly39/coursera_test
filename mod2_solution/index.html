      <h3>Instant Pot Beef Stew</h3>

When cubes of beef, sweet carrots, and potatoes cook slowly together in a savory sauce, the resulting stew makes you want to grab a hunk of crusty bread and dig in. And thanks to your Instant Pot, the whole thing comes together in about an hour..<br>
  <h3>Garlic Butter Steak Bites</h3>
Garlic-butter steak bites are everything you love about a steakhouse steak, with none of the work. Instead of cooking a whole steak, pieces of New York strip steak get cooked in a gorgeous garlic butter that’s built in the same pan the steak is cooked in. Pretty ingenious, right?

    <h3>Spicy Chicken Taquitos</h3>
   They make a great anytime meal and bring the party themselves. We've included both a way to bake the taquitos and to make them in the air fryer. The air fryer makes them even crispier in less time! However you make them, be sure to load them up with homemade salsa and the avocado cream sauce.<br>
  <h3>Huli-Huli Chicken</h3>
  Originating in Hawaii, this recipe is really all about the sauce. Pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, and (stay with us) ketchup make for an insanely delicious base, and plenty of garlic and ginger bring some acidity and brightness.

  <h3>Chirashi Sushi</h3>
   Chirashi sushi, meaning scattered sushi, is a style of sushi where the topping is placed in a bowl over a bed of rice. Commonly, nine toppings are used (nine is a very important number in Japanese culture), however you can certainly use how ever many are available to you.<br>
  <h3>Sashimi Sushi</h3>
  Sashimi is a great way to enjoy seafood. Without the rice, the true essence of the fish comes through, and with just a dab of shoyu to enhance it, this is the purist’s dream. Some fish take very well to being served in this style, particularly the fattier cuts of tuna, toro, chu-toro, and o-toro.
